# SendToUser
This is an example of how you can send specific messages to users. Make sure you use a SmartNotify-based phone number or your text message operations will fail miserably :)

You can also select the channel.  At this time your options are:
Preferred, id: 0  Here we use our algo to do the routing
Text-to-Voice, id: 1,
Text/SMS, id: 2,
Email, id: 3,
Twitter, id: 4,
SmartCast, id: 6 This is the mobile app option
